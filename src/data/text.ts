    content:
      "Technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. Over the last century, advancements in technology have transformed society at an unprecedented pace. From the invention of the telephone to the rise of the internet, each milestone has brought the world closer together. Today, smartphones have become an extension of ourselves, offering everything from navigation to entertainment at our fingertips. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling smarter systems capable of decision-making and problem-solving. However, this rapid evolution has also raised concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical implications. As we continue to innovate, it is vital to strike a balance between technological progress and its societal impact. While technology can empower and connect, it must also respect human values and ensure inclusivity for a better future.",

    content:
      "Mental health is an integral part of overall well-being, yet it often receives less attention than physical health. In today's fast-paced world, stress, anxiety, and depression are increasingly common. Recognizing the importance of mental health involves understanding that it affects how we think, feel, and behave in daily life. Just as we exercise and eat healthy to maintain physical fitness, nurturing mental health requires self-care, mindfulness, and seeking support when needed. Conversations about mental health have become more open in recent years, but stigma still exists in many communities. Breaking this barrier requires education, empathy, and access to resources. By prioritizing mental health, we can improve productivity, strengthen relationships, and foster a more compassionate society.",

    content:
      "Space exploration has always captured the imagination of humankind. Since the launch of Sputnik in 1957, humans have ventured beyond Earth's atmosphere to unlock the mysteries of the universe. The moon landing in 1969 was a monumental achievement that showcased humanity's ingenuity and determination. Today, missions to Mars, the study of distant galaxies, and the search for extraterrestrial life continue to expand our understanding of the cosmos. Space exploration has practical benefits as well, such as the development of satellite technology and Earth observation tools that help combat climate change. However, the high cost and environmental impact of space missions are subjects of debate. As private companies join the space race, the future of exploration seems more promising than ever. Each discovery reminds us of our small yet significant place in the universe and inspires us to push the boundaries of what is possible.",

    content:
      "Education is the cornerstone of a prosperous society. It provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to contribute to their communities and achieve personal growth. From early childhood education to lifelong learning, the process of acquiring knowledge empowers people to think critically and solve problems. Quality education fosters innovation, reduces inequality, and promotes social cohesion. In the digital age, access to education has expanded through online platforms, making learning more accessible to remote and underserved populations. However, challenges such as affordability, gender disparity, and outdated curricula remain. By investing in education and embracing inclusive policies, societies can unlock the potential of their citizens and build a brighter future. Education is not just a privilege but a right that must be safeguarded for everyone.",

    title: "Climate Change",
    content:
      "The climate is the commonly considered to be the weather averaged over a long period of time, typically 30 years. Somewhat more precisely, the concept of “climate” also includes the statistics of the weather—such as the degree of day-to-day or year-to-year variation expected. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) glossary definition is: Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. The factors that determine the climate at a location are the rainfall, sunshine, wind, humidity and temperature. Climate change refers to long term changes in climate including overage temperature and precipitation. Earth’s climate is changing and this is causing great concern. The changes place in the atmosphere have become one of the serious threats that world faces today. Human activities have the potential to disturb the balance of natural systems and cause warming of the plant to an unprecedented extent. Some of these countries are increasing the greenhouse gases emission to an extent that nature system is now not able to assimilate these gases. As a result, climate change has started endangering biodiversity, food and fresh water supply, impacting human health worldwide, especially in developing countries like India due to low adaptive capacity. Indias climate can be classified as a hot tropical country, except the northern states of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in the north and Sikkim in the northeastern hills, which have a cooler, more continental influenced climate. In most of India summer is very hot. In India, summer, winter, and the rainy season are considered to be the main seasons. We also divide the year into six seasons, namely, vasant, grishma, varsha, sharad, hemant and shishir.",

    title: "Positive Thinking - SSC CGL Previous Year's Passage",
    content:
      "Is positive thinking an inherent characteristic of a person or can it (69) be developed in one's psyche? The opinions differ in answering this vital question. Some people believe that it can be inherited from parents, and cannot be developed. Others believe that like other qualities it can be developed with proper practice and guidance. Still some others hold the opinion that it is hereditary to some extent but can be acquired to some degree. There is also a section of people, who believe that all depends on circumstances or luck. We need to adopt a scientific approach to find an answer to the above question. No one can get success every time even after making efforts, nor can one fail constantly. Moreover, success has different meaning for different people. For some students, getting 60 per cent marks is success, for others it may not be sufficient. In a competitive examination, success means getting selected, whatever the percentage of marks. As for inheritance theory, since positive attitude is not a physical feature but a mental faculty, it cannot be purely hereditary. It can be developed. Moreover, parents play a major role in developing this quality of a child. A child, who watches his parents working hard, having faith in success through their words, behaviour and body language, is likely to develop a similar attitude. The children of short-tempered, over-cautious and nervous parents may assume similar characteristics when they grow up. Psychologists, therefore, prescribe a code of conduct for parents' behaviour in front of their children. They must exude confidence, self-belief and hope, especially in difficult situation, so that the children emulate these qualities. They must be taught the importance of being positive before, during and after the performance of a task. There is no better education for a child than watching his parents come out of a tough situation by means of earnest endeavours. Such success not only gives more joy but also increases self-confidence.",

      "As the House knows, the Prime Minister sent out a circular to all the States a few years ago requesting that the portfolio of agriculture in the States should not be neglected; it should be entrusted to an important Minister. I think the National Development Council considered this question and they said that as far as possible, the Chief Ministers in the States should handle the portfolio themselves. And then, they have started a Food Production Board in the Cabinet itself at the Centre, and the National Development Council has decide that an agricultural production board should be started in each State with the Chief Minister as the Chairman. They have started an agricultural machinery board for supplying machinery. They have taken many steps in addition to the normal measures. The Government has been doing their very best in this regard. But with all that, it has not kept up with the targets fixed, unless earnest and vigorous attempts are made. I wish to throw out my own suggestions in this regard. They may not be very pleasant but I wish to be excused because I am speaking from experience. Madam, the first thing is that so far as the producing agency is concerned, its voluntary interest and its enthusiasm must be won. For instance, in industrial labour relations, we got out of the way to invite labour and give it even participation in the management and to do everything for labour. This is just to see that industrial relations are good and the industrial output will be increasing day by day. Should we not show some consideration for this producing agency, namely, the farmer? Mr. Thomas has shown how agricultural products, even at these increased prices, are not paying to the agriculturist. He has shown that very correctly, and everyone who has intimate connection with agriculture at least will agree to that, and if at all anything, that is an under-estimate, not an over-estimate. When that is so, how can we expect the farmer to produce unless he is enthused?",

      "Under the National Drinking Water Mission, the guinea worm problem which is prevalent in only six States will now be eliminated by the end of the current year. Similarly, the Central Government has taken several steps to remove the excess quantity of fluoride from drinking water. Alternative sources of clean drinking water and equipment to remove fluoride will be made available to the affected villages. For both the works, a special provision to provide funds to the States is being made. Public awakening campaign is being launched in this regard. The Government has taken the decision to open laboratories at all the places for the qualitative testing of drinking water. I would also like to point out that the constructed amenities provided for the disposal of dirt and dirty water are comparatively very inadequate. This issue will be taken up for discussion at an early date in the National Seminar and the policy will undergo change. I would like to mention that the World Bank and many countries of the world are: extending their assistance for the implementation of these two programmes. The programme started to make available drinking water in villages through Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission, is the biggest in the world and has become a model for other developing countries. In order to have systematic agricultural development and to maintain it, an effective system is essential for marketing of agricultural products so that the interests of producers and consumers may be safeguarded. A model Act has been circulated to the States in order to make uniformity in the regulation and management of markets. In order to provide basic infrastructure facilities for these markets under a Centrally-sponsored programme, the committees of the trade centers are given monetary assistance to the markets through the State Government. Now, both the programmes for the development of markets and construction of village godowns have been entrusted to the State Governments.",

The various recommendations of the select committee has been incorporated in the Bill. In addition, the wishes expressed by some of the Members of the Lok Sabha have been incorporated in the Bill. The difficulties of small growers have been apprecrated and the major portion of the acreage of rubber cultivation is held by the small growers. Proper representation to these small producers of rubber will be given. The labour representatives in the Board have been increased from three to four. The labour representatives will be selected from out of the panel of names submitted by the respective associations an important provision has been made in the Bill to enable the Board to take steps to secure better working conditions for workers engaged in the rubber industry. The present production, of rubber is about twenty thousand tons a year, the demand is increasing every year, while the supply is not keeping pace with the demand. It is proposed to fill up the gap over the short period by importing rubber. The Bill, when passed would enable the Board to import rubber and a provision has been made as to how any profits that are made out of this import of rubber should be utilised. To increase the, production of rubber, it is proposed to take up the development scheme. The details of which are being worked out. It appears that at present the small grower is at a great disadvantage, as far as the marketing of his rubber is concerned. This problem is rather difficult to solve However, provisions have been made for the Rubber Board to take up marketing of rubber also. It is hoped that the new Board will be able to tackle the problem of the small grower of rubber industry successfully. The Rubber industry has established itself as a major industry in India. India ranks high in natural rubber production.",

      "Sir, the Press Council Second Amendment Bill was introduced by me in the last session, as I submitted in my statement which I laid on the Table of the House. I request the House to consider the Second Amendment because an Ordinance had to be issued since the life of the Council was expiring. Since the life of the present council was expiring, we had to issue the Ordinance. At this stage, I do not think have much to say because it is a very simple Bill. It is only trying to extend the life of the Press Council till the end of the year. If we are able to finalize the formation of the Press Council earlier, then, of course, the present term would expire earlier. You will recall, I had said in the course of the last debate that a Committee of Members of Parliament has been working for the drafting of the second Bill, which is likely to come up before the end of this session. The Committee has been sitting and they have been able to come to their conclusions more or less. It is now in the drafting stage and I hope it will be possible for me to bring the Bill before the House soon, 1 would not like to go into the merits and demerits of the new Bill at this stage. Would only say that it is a very simple Bill extending the life of the present Council. I hope the House will approve of this at an early date so that I can go to the other House before the Budget debate is taken up. No doubt about it; it is a very simple Bill dealing with merely the term of the Press Council and giving life to the Press Council which would have otherwise expired. Do not object to the contents of the Bill. It has been my general objection that Article 123 of the Constitution, which empowers the President to promulgate Ordinances during the recess of Parliament, is a very special power. Therefore, Sir, it is an extraordinary power which has to be exercised with very great caution and care and only in an emergent situation. The First Amendment provides that Congress make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise.",

      "In the last few years, thanks to jobs becoming global, the importance of English has increased manifold. It has over the years become an important medium of communication, both at the international and intra-national levels. The importance of spoken English is even more, because here are many cases. Where one knows his subject well, but fails to communicate it properly. The practice of spoken English, therefore, is quite essential. Learning English in a country where it is not a native language, opens a number of opportunities for the Individual. An individual can make strides in the management ladder if he or she can speak English fluently. If your English is poor even though with brilliant business ideas, you may still find yourself languishing at the bottom of the management ladder. Your productivity will drop over a period of time since you will find difficulty in expressing your brilliant ideas. Those who can speak good English will probably usurp your ideas and get the credit for all the hard work you did. Group discussion is one of the ways to test someone's communicative skills generally before the final interview for a job. An English language trainer trains the candidates for group discussions. While training the candidates, the trainer aims at grooming the whole personality etc. He usually organizes number of mock interviews to make the candidates confident and to assess them as where they are lacking in order to fill the gap. Fear of speaking in front of groups is one of the greatest fears people have. Here, the role of a trainer is very crucial who trains the candidates in practices confidence, and how to concentrate on his or her message. The trainer begins with a strategy that includes understanding your purpose and role. Then he makes the candidate team how to structure his material into a meaningful message. English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, with its earliest forms spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval England.",

      "Money stashed abroad is not always the money, which has been evaded from payment of taxes. Drug lords, terrorists groups, gangsters all over the world, along with International Syndicates also keep their money in safe heavens, where they can lay their hands on it in times of need for their operational purposes. There is no mechanism with the Government to determine and say with cent per cent surety that the money hoarded abroad is only the one that has been evaded from payment of taxes and not the other crime linked cash. The Revenue Department and other agencies of the Government like the RAW and State Trading Organisations have their offices abroad. There is no common mandate to them to report any suspicious transactions by the Indians either visiting or staying abroad. The stark truth is that the black money is the result of high level corruption prevailing in our country. The schemes meant for the poor, even as per the Government reports, are not implemented and the money siphoned off. Even laws permit every criminal whether in jail or on bail to hide their names and crimes and create false alibis. But, here the Government is creating alibis for those people whose names have been received and disclosed as the persons who are having cash, which is got illegally and is not from any known legal sources. They have stashed this cash in safe tax heavens abroad. Even the Supreme Court, the Apex Court of India, says that nothing moves without bribery in India. A good and alert cop even on a tourist visa can spot Indians roaming about and visiting these safe tax heavens on Swiss banks. The rest of the job of tracing the flight of black money from India can be done locally provided the Government has the will. So far, the Government has been making excuses, some tenable and some untenable.",

      "Stretching s specific tendon or muscle can improve the elasticity of muscles, which in turn helps in achieving a comfortable muscle tone. There are several benefits of regular stretching, and it should be an integral part of every workout program. It not only helps increase your flexibility, which is an important part of fitness, but it can also improve your posture, body aches, reduce stress, and much more. One of the benefits of regular stretching is that it enhances flexibility. Being flexible has its own advantages, as it not only improves your day to day activities, but can also help delay the reduced mobility that comes with aging. Stretching 9on a regular basis can help increase your range of motion. You can either go for static or dynamic stretching as they both are effective when it comes to the increasing range of motion. According to the studies, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation or PNF type of stretching is more effective for immediate results. Regular stretching can not only help heal an existing back injury but can also prevent future back pain by reducing your risk for muscle strain and strengthening your back muscles. All the people who regularly go to the gym know how helpful stretching can be. Performing dynamic stretches prior to exercise in the gym can help prepare your muscles. Not the only gym, but it can also help you improve your performance in dance or an athletic event. It is only natural that your muscles get tense when you experience physical or emotional stress. This is because the tightening of your muscles is the response of the body towards stress. All you need to do is focus on the areas of your body where you feel the stress, such as your neck, shoulders, etc. and stretch those parts of your body.",

    content:
      "Iodine fortification is what most countries rely on to encourage adequate dietary intake. In more than seventy countries that iodize salt generally serves as the major source of iodine intake. One fourth of a teaspoon of iodized salts has about hundred micrograms of iodine. Note that the salt used in processed foods, which is the major source of salt for most Americans typically does not contain iodine. If salt used in a processed food contains iodine, it will be listed in the ingredients list of that food. Focus on decreasing the amount of salt consumed from processed foods and get your sodium from iodized salt. Seaweed, saltwater fish and seafood are natural sources of dietary iodine. Dairy products also supply iodine in the diet at varying levels. During lactation, the breast concentrates iodine in milk so breastmilk tends be a good source of iodine as long as the iodine intake of a mother is adequate. Plants grown in iodine rich soil are also good sources. However, this is not a reliable source of iodine since there is no way of knowing whether produce purchased in grocery stores is grown in iodine rich soil or not. Iodized salt usually adds less than about three hundred micrograms iodine daily to the diet. Most multivitamin mineral supplements contain 150 micrograms of iodine. With the safe upper limit of daily iodine intake for adults set at 1,100 micrograms by the IOM it is unlikely to hit an excess amount when including a multivitamin and including natural sources of dietary iodine. The trend of eating less table salt, dairy and bread has some experts concerned that iodine deficiency could be on the rise again. Eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes iodine rich foods and iodized salt is key to good health.",

It is also stated that the BoB will focus on the operational costs, customer satisfaction and will try to maximize profit. Historically, the experience of bank mergers or amalgamations in India is mixed. In most cases, improvement was not much. Even the recent merger of associated banks of the State Bank of India into the SBI has not been very satisfactory. A bank has to do its business in a complex environment where domestic and international economic factors influence it. Even political interference is not absent. Now, private and public sector banks are doing business in a common market. Practically, these two categories do not do their jobs in the same way. Therefore, the BOB faces several challenges in the days to come. There are many big banks that have either liquidated or face great financial trouble. Amalgamation cannot be an end in itself, Some of the challenges are internal to the bank and same are external to it Some of the internal challenges, as has been pointed out, are first, Dena Bank and BoB has a similar background and culture, which can be takes as the old Gujarati culture. But Vijaya Bank came from a different milieu. So, some cultural shock in human resources development is expected Second, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank had a huge baggage of NPA. Third, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank had a large exposer to trade finance. In this sector, asset recovery is more difficult.

It can try to solve the existing problems in the country and also carry forward the process of growth that has been achieved so far. A Budget has to be implemented in a number of parameters. We have to look at the parameters and then judge the Budget. After looking from all these angles, I would say that the Union Budget is a good Budget, Among other things, the most salient aspect of this Budget is that it carries the mandate given in the Common Minimum Programme. The Budget has to carry forward all the plans and schemes that have been given in the Plan and it has to serve the goals of not only growth but also inclusive growth. Only growth can relieve India from the clutches of poverty and unemployment. No magic remedies are available except that we have to promote sustained growth in agriculture, sustained growth in industry and sustained growth in infrastructure. Without that it is not possible, and that would be possible only with generous fundings. Sir, I rise to support the General Budget which has been presented by the hon. Finance Minister. He deserved our appreciation for presenting the growth- oriented Budget. As you know, this is the fifth Budget of the hon. Finance Minister as well as of this Government. In my considered view, this is the finest of all the Budgets which has been presented by this Government. Some hon. Members were finding fault with the Government for not eradicating poverty and not reducing inequalities in this country. These are all old problems and cannot be tackled by Budget. A budget expresses intended expenditures along with proposals for how to meet them with resources.

For a mature mind, reading is the greatest source of pleasure and solace to distressed minds. The study of good books ennobles us and broadens our outlook. Therefore, the habit of reading should be cultivated. A student should never confine himself to his schoolbooks only. He should not miss the pleasure locked in the classics, poetry, drama, history, philosophy etc. We can derive benefit from other’s experiences with the help of books. The various sufferings, endurance and joy described in books enable us to have a closer look at human life. They also inspire us to face the hardships of life courageously. Nowadays there are innumerable books and time is scarce. So we should read only the best and the greatest among them. With the help of books we shall be able to make our thinking mature and our life more meaningful and worthwhile.

      "Days are not of equal value in one’s life. Some bring happiness while others bring sadness. Sadness and happiness both are equally important to man’s life, since they are the two sides of a coin. As we cannot forget the happiest day, we are unable to forget the saddest day of our life too. The saddest day of my life was the Diwali Day. Diwali is considered to be a happy festival and till last Diwali, it was my favorite festival. On last Diwali, my sister, my brother and I were busy lighting the fireworks. I was holding a ‘fuljhari’ in my hand and unfortunately my younger brother, who was standing just beside me, had a cracker in his hand. This cracker caught fire and a very loud explosion was heard which shook my sister and me. After that, we all could think of nothing else than blood stained cotton, bandage, dettol etc. My cousin took my brother to the doctor where he got 14 stitches in his forefinger and thumb. But at home, everybody kept cursing and blaming me for the mishap. That night, I could not sleep and I cried a lot. For next few days, I bore the burden of this blame for being responsible for this unfortunate incident. I felt deeply guilty conscious which I was able to overcome after a long time. Life Is Action, Not Contemplation: Life offers many opportunities to us to succeed and see it closely. But action is required for it. Goethe, a German philosopher rightly remarked that ‘Life is action, not contemplation’. Even Charles Darvin proved that this life is a continuous struggle for the ‘survival of the fittest’. One who is not suitable perishes - this is nature’s law. Action is necessary to adjust ourselves in any possible circumstances. Dreams are the necessary propellers but life itself is not merely a dream or reverie. Sitting on a chair, brooding, man would never have been able to reach the moon. But man thought, imagined and strove. Consequently we reached the hitherto unknown heights. Thus a life of thought and reflection will be futile if man does not try to make it come true in real life.",

      "Banwarilal is a simple soul who believes whatever he is told. The village boys are aware of this and exploit his simplicity for a few laughs. One day, Banwarilal is on his way to the market with his son to sell their donkey. He comes across some village boys out to have fun. Seeing the father and son duo walking with the donkey, they first suggest that let the son ride on the donkey and save the effort. The son is put on the donkey’s back. The boys then ridicule the boy for riding while the father walks. The father and son switch places. The father rides while the son walks. The boys then taunt the father for making the poor son walk and advise the duo to ride the donkey together. Thinking it a good idea they comply. The poor donkey collapses from exhaustion. The boys then express their disgust at the duo for ill-treating the donkey and advice that they take the donkey to an animal doctor. The duo again follows the advice. On the way, they come across barking stray dogs. In the confusion that ensues, the donkey falls into the flowing river. The donkey is lost forever. Banwarilal loses the donkey because he follows what he is suggested without thinking for himself. Moral: He who listens to everybody will only become a laughing stock. One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug! The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy. The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked! Moral: Think and work hard, you may find solution to any problem.",

    content:
      "At the beginning of the eighteenth century, France was a monarchy ruled by an autocratic king. The French society was divided into three Estates, or classes. The First Estate consisted of the clergy. The Second Estate consisted of the nobility. The Third Estate consisted of the peasants and the bourgeoisie, which included professionals and the wealthy merchants. The First and Second Estates enjoyed many privileges, and paid almost no taxes. Wealth was concentrated in their hands. The Third Estate had no privileges. This Estate bore the burden of taxation. The peasants had to perform unpaid compulsory services. Tax default was punished with imprisonment in the state prison called the Bastille, which became a symbol of oppression. Inspired by the democratic ideas of French philosophers like Rousseau, Voltaire and Montesquieu, the bourgeoisie demanded political rights and government by the consent of the people. Estates-General France had an assembly called the Estates-General, meant to represent all the three Estates. The Estates-General, however, was never summoned between 1614 and 1789. Benazir Bhutto: Benazir was assassinated on December 27, 2007 in Rawalpindi by the Islamic terrorists, when she was addressing one of the election meetings due to be held soon afterwards. Her death postponed the elections; the Pakistan People’s Party triumphed at the polls thereby shattering the dream of Nawaz Sharief of the Muslim League to occupy power. Zardari, in his earlier avatar as Consort of Benazir, earned nickname of Mr. 10%. Lo & behold, Mr. 10% now becomes head of the State. Zardari has visited a number of countries in his quest to seek foreign financial assistance and military assistance to defeat the Taliban. The monster created by Pakistan refuses to vanish and is now determined to destabilize the country and bring down the entire superstructure. The Swat Valley in early 2009 was occupied by the Islamic militants before they were ousted by a determined army action.",

His incredible lust for knowledge has revolutionised human life and raised the standard of life. He was able to invent innumerable ways of making his life comfortable and happy. Every sphere of life has been revolutionized by science. There have been innumerable inventions. One of the greatest inventions is the invention of medicines. There has been a series of tests carried out using animals as subjects and various medicines have been tried out on these animals to check their efficacy. Many fatal diseases can now be cured because we have the drug to fight those diseases. It has reduced the rate of infant mortality and increased the life span. Before these inventions millions of people died for lack of medical care. Science has given us many machines that have made our lives very comfortable. Buses, cars, sewing machines, mixies, grinders, etc. are all machines that are used every day by us and the discovery of electricity has made it possible for us to change night into day and summer into a comfortable cool season. It is now easy to cultivate fields as we have tractors. New forms of irrigation are now being employed. It is easier to protect the crops because of the use of various chemicals and pesticides.

The mobile phones have undertaken a fascinating journey from worldwide internet messaging content and multimedia messaging to camera phones, to location based services, mobile phone televisions, 3G phones etc. Mobile revolution is not only mind-boggling but also quite dramatic with the rapid pace of change in technology. Today, life without mobile phones is not only unimaginable but also unlikely. The conventional land lines, cumbersome and outdated, appear redundant and obsolete in comparison to these handy little gadgets. Gone are the days, when you needed a telephone directory in order to look for the phone number, you wish to dial. The utility of these sleek little phones is such that even if one has the option of using a land line one usually prefers to use this amazing device because of its easy accessibility. With advancement in science and technology, every new model which comes in the market is superior to its previous one, with more options and wider range of services. It provides access to entertainment and opens up a vast new world of information, work and play, so comprehensive, immediate and useful that one wonders how one can get along without it and how one had functioned so long without this utility. Multitude of internet based services is also available on these hand sets on which one can down load any music, video game and so on. Today, one can buy tickets over a phone but soon phones could become the payment method itself. There is no doubt that today India is one of the large consumers of mobile phones witnessing one of the greatest electronic revolutions of our times. Mobile phones have amazingly and interesting impacted our lives as they allow us to walk away with them and to own ourselves completely, most importantly they are very intimate and ha an extraordinary reach.

    title: "Science vs Religion",
    content:
      "Whatever might be the origin of science and religion, the main point is their area of activity and their method of working. Science makes a man rational and free-minded. Religion wants man to believe blindly in what he is told to be true and worthy of being practiced. Science asks questions and puts every thesis or proposal to test. Religion abhors such methods. Science believes in logical experiments and wants to declare something truthful and true if it comes out finally resultant of the experiment. Religion pre-supposes the result and wants to stick to it irrespective of the outcome of investigation, inquiry or experiment. So, religion and science both are complementary to each other. For mankind, both are required in equal measure and simultaneously. Thus intrinsically, both are essential for man. The role of education as an agent or instrument of social change and social development is widely recognised today. Social change may take place: (i) When human needs change. (ii) When the existing social system or network of social institutions fail to meet the existing human needs, and (iii) When new materials suggest better ways of meeting human needs. Social changes do not take place automatically or by themselves. As MacIver says, social change takes place as a response to many types of changes that take place in the social and non-social environment. Education can initiate social changes by bringing about a change in outlook and attitude of man. It can bring about: a change in the pattern of social relationships and thereby it may cause social changes. There was a time when educational institutions and teachers were engaged in transmitting a way of life to the students. During those days, education was more a means of social control than an instrument of social change. Modern schools, colleges and universities do not place much emphasis; upon transmitting a way of life to the students. The traditional education was meant for an unchanging, static society, not marked by rapid changes.",

      "Assam, known as the land of blue hills and red river, is also a land of many feasts and festivals, which are marked by music, dance, mirth, gaiety, community sharing, and spiritual colouring. Among these, Bihu is the most impressive and prominent. Bihu is the chief festival of the people of Assam celebrated by everyone irrespective of caste, creed, and race. Assamese celebrate three types of Bihus in a yearRongaali Bihu or Bohaag Bihu, Kati Bihu or Kongaali Bihu and Magh Bihu or Bhogaali Bihu. The word ‘Bihu’ comes from the Sanskrit word ‘Vishu’. The Bihus are closely associated with the farmer’s life, which characterises ancient rural Assamese life. It marks three distinct phases in the cultivation of paddy-the native crop of Assam. Bohaag Bihu marks the advent of planting time, the Kati Bihu is celebrated at the completion of sowing season while Magh Bihu symbolises the culmination of harvesting period. Rongaali Bihu is the most important Bihu among the three Bihus. It is celebrated in the month of Bohaag, the first month of the Assamese calendar. Thus, the festival marks the advent of Assamese New year. Hence, it is characterized by lots of merriment, gaiety, songs and dance. The festival coincides with the arrival of spring season in the state providing greater reason for merriment. The nature is in its finest form fully adorned with blossoms and flowers. Therefore, this Bihu is known as Rongaali Bihu or the festival of merriment (‘Rong’ means joy in Assamese). Bihu festivals are an integral part of Assamese life and culture. Bihu geet or Bihu songs constitute an important part of Assam’s rich heritage and literature. The uniqueness of Bihu celebrations is that they are celebrated by everyone in Assam irrespective of caste, creed, or race. The festivals are true community festivals and promote a sprit of love, brotherhood and sense of oneness among the people. It is therefore, the duty of every Assamese to preserve these national festivals in their original form and grandeur.",

    title: "Water Scarcity: A Global Challenge for the Future",
    content:
      "It is said that around 3.7 billion years ago, the earth cooled down and had warm oceans. In these warm water bodies, the first single-celled organisms evolved. Thus, water was instrumental in the origin of life. 70% of the earth is covered with water, and up to 70% of the human body is made of water. Today we have millions of marine species, but many plants and animals evolved to survive in non-saline conditions. The human civilization rose on the banks of rivers. Early human beings settled down along the fertile river basins as it was easy for growing crops, and was convenient for transportation too. Presently, agriculture demands for 70% of the freshwater needs. Industries and domestic uses share the rest thirty percent. But this precious resource has become scarce due to many human-made reasons. Only three percent of the total water available is freshwater. But more than sixty percent of this potable water is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Moreover, we haven't kept our water bodies clean. Industrial effluents and sewage discharges are directly let into rivers. In cities, buildings come up on dried ponds and lakes. So, when it rains, we don't have the facility to store the rainwater. Therefore, we not only have frequent flash floods, but the rainwater goes to the sea and gets wasted. We use the fertile soil from riverbeds carelessly, and it leads to flooding in riverine areas too. So, we humans are primarily responsible for reducing the holding capacity of water bodies. We live in concrete jungles, and a green cover is almost missing in our cities. It is the roots of trees that help in retention of groundwater. Moreover, plants release oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. Thus, they are instrumental in curbing global warming. Lesser warming implies a slower melting of ice sheets and glaciers, thereby, preserving the largest source of freshwater. Floods and storms are natural events, but nature has its way of replenishing the water that flows into the seas.",

This festival is celebrated all over the country as a day filled with complete mischief, fun and enjoyment. Holi indicates the end of the winters and the beginning of the spring season. According to the Hindu calendar it is celebrated on the full-moon night of the month of Phalgun. Holi is celebrated to mark the victory of truth over evil, the victory of Prahlad over King Hiranyakashyap. Prahlad was a devotee of God. His father, King Hiranyakashyap did not believe in God but-believed in his own powers. He failed to deviate his son’s devotion to God and decided to kill him by burning him alive. Prahlad’s sister, Holika, had a God-gifted boon that she would not be burnt in the fire. She sat with her nephew in the blazing fire. Holika let herself be burnt and Prahlad was saved. The truth, the powers of the Supreme God, defeated the false evil. During the day women folk worship a stack of wooden logs called Holi. At the end of the day in the full-moon night Holi is burnt in a holy way. The green ears of barley and gram are heated up in the fire and distributed among friends and relatives new. Friendships are made and old enmities are forgotten. Next day is the festive day of Holi. All hearts are filled with joy. Children throw colored water on each other while the elder people apply ‘gulal’ or ‘abir’, There are noisy scenes as little groups of children move from one locality to another exchanging holi greetings, singing songs and laughing at their own jokes. It is almost mid-day when people move indoors to freshen themselves. Though this is a festival of brotherhood and unity, it has some disadvantages too. Some ill-minded people-take this day as a chance to take revenge. They use dirty mud water. Use of strong colors harmful to the skin, charcoal and grease often create a serious quarrel. This leads to unnecessary enmity and spoils the charm of the festival",

    content:
      "An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to technology (automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education). A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of human practices and transactions. It does not stand alone. A market-based economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency.",

Accepting the command of the Emperor, Birbal left the kingdom and started working in a farmer’s farm in an unknown village far away under a different identity. As months passed, Akbar started to miss Birbal. He was struggling to solve many issues in the empire without Birbal’s advice. He regretted a decision, asking Birbal to leave the empire in anger. So Akbar sent his soldiers to find Birbal, but they failed to find him. No one knew where Birbal was. Akbar finally found a trick. He sent a message to the head of every village to send a pot full of the wit to the Emperor. If the pot full of wit can not be sent, fill the pot with diamonds and jewels. This message also reached Birbal, who lived in one of the villages. The people of the village got together. All started talking about what to do now? The wit is not a thing, which can be filled in the pot. How will we arrange for diamonds and jewels to fill the pot and send to the Emperor? Birbal who was sitting among the villagers said, “Give me the pot, I will fill the wit in one month’s end”. Everyone trusted Birbal and agreed to give him a chance. They still didn’t know his identity. Birbal took the pot with him and went back to the farm. He had planted watermelons on his farm. He selected a small watermelon and without cutting it from the plant, he put that in the pot. He started looking after it by providing water and fertilizer regularly. Within a few days, the watermelon grew into a pot so much that it was impossible to get it out of the pot. Soon, the watermelon reached to the same size as the pot from inside. Birbal then cut the watermelon from the vine and separated it with the pot. Birbal sealed the pot with a lid and handed it over to the villagers. He said, "Take this pot to Emperor Akbar and tell him it is filled with wit. Let him figure out how to retrieve it without breaking the pot." The villagers, still unaware of Birbal\'s true identity, were puzzled but trusted his wisdom. They carried the pot to the royal court and presented it to Emperor Akbar, narrating how one of their villagers had claimed to fill it with wit. Intrigued, Akbar opened the pot and saw the watermelon inside. He was puzzled at first, but soon a smile spread across his face as he realized the brilliance behind the act. Akbar exclaimed, "This is indeed wit! The person who came up with this idea is no ordinary man. This must be Birbal\'s work!" He then turned to the villagers and asked, "Who is the wise man who filled this pot?" The villagers replied, "Your Majesty, he is a farmer in our village. We don’t know much about him, but he works diligently in the fields." Akbar immediately sent his soldiers to bring the farmer to the court. When Birbal was brought before Akbar, the Emperor\'s eyes lit up with joy. "Birbal! I knew only you could think of something so clever. Forgive me for my harshness. I should never have sent you away." Birbal bowed and said, "Your Majesty, a ruler’s anger should be like a line drawn on water—quick to disappear. I am always at your service." Akbar, moved by Birbal\'s wisdom and loyalty, reinstated him as the chief minister. From that day onward, Akbar vowed to control his temper and to never let his anger cloud his judgment again. The court and the kingdom celebrated Birbal\'s return, and peace and prosperity were restored under his wise counsel. The story of the "pot of wit" spread far and wide, a timeless reminder of Birbal\'s brilliance and Akbar\'s eventual humility.',

Though his family barely scraped by, James always had big dreams of making it in the bustling world of business. He excelled in school but lacked the funds to attend college. At 18, after his father lost his job due to factory downsizing, James left home for New York City with nothing but $100 in his pocket and an old suitcase. He struggled to survive in the city, working odd jobs such as delivering pizzas, cleaning offices, and even sleeping in subway stations to save on rent. But James was resourceful. In his free time, he spent hours at the public library teaching himself about finance, investing, and entrepreneurship. One day, while delivering pizzas to a corporate office, James overheard two employees discussing a problem with real estate market trends and their lack of proper data visualization. An idea struck him. James realized there was a gap in the market for a tool that could provide accessible, data-driven insights into real estate trends for small investors. Using free online coding tutorials and borrowed library books, James taught himself how to build a basic web application. After months of hard work, he created a prototype of a platform he called "ClearView Analytics." With no connections in the tech world, James started pitching his idea to local small-business owners and landlords, promising to help them make smarter investments. His pitch was compelling, and he managed to secure a small loan from a kind landlord who believed in his vision. With this funding, James launched ClearView Analytics and worked tirelessly to improve the platform. Within two years, ClearView Analytics gained traction, attracting attention from major real estate firms and venture capitalists. By the time James was 25, his company had grown exponentially, earning him his first million dollars. By 30, James had expanded the platform globally and become a billionaire. James’s story became an inspiration for millions. He often spoke about his journey at conferences, emphasizing the importance of resilience, self-learning, and seizing opportunities in unexpected places. Despite his success, James remained grounded and started a foundation to help young entrepreneurs from underprivileged backgrounds pursue their dreams—just as he once had. Today, James Carter is not only known as a tech innovator but also as a symbol of hope for anyone striving to turn their rags-to-riches dream into reality.',
